# Weather Web Application

This web application allows users to check the current weather for a location by making asynchronous requests to a weather API. It provides a user-friendly interface with various features:

## Features

- **Homepage:** The homepage provides a simple user interface with a search input field and a "Get Weather" button to retrieve weather data.

- **Weather Display:** The app displays current weather conditions for the specified location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description.

- **Error Handling:** The app gracefully handles cases where the location is not found or when there's an issue with the API request, displaying user-friendly error messages.

- **Unit Selection:** Users can switch between temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) using a toggle or dropdown, with the weather data updating accordingly.

- **Optional Geolocation:** Users have the option to use their geolocation to fetch weather data for their current location, with appropriate geolocation permission requests.

- **Styling:** The app is visually appealing with a well-thought-out layout, color scheme, and readability.

- **Responsive Design:** The app is responsive and functions well on both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring usability on various screen sizes.
